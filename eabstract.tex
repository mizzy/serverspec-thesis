As the increase of large and complex systems, many ways to describe states of servers as code are proposed.As the effective process to handle these ways, Test-Driven Infrastructure is proposed.It is the application of Test-Driven Development to the server configuration.Several test frameworks that support this process are appearing, but they have difficulty in vesatility because some frameworks depend on specific configuration management tools and others need the consideration of differences between OSes to write test code.In this paper, we propose a test framework that doesn't depend on specific configuration management tools or OSes for testing states of servers by versatile and readable code.In our proposal, we arrange and generalize the behavior of OSes and configuration management tools and define the versatile command execution framework for increasing the versatility. Next, we define the test framework that control the command execution framework by declarative description to increase the level of abstraction and readability.By this test framework, system administrators can test states of servers easily without considering the diffrences between OSes or configuration management tools, and can decrease the costs of server operations.Also by defining the frameworks separated into purposes, we can change the control test framework to another one that have original notation easily.We named the proposed test framework serverspec.
